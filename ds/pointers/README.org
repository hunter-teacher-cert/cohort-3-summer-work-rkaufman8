** Instructions

Note: this assignment should be completed on paper with pen or pencil.

*** part 1
Using the code for Node.java in this directory, trace through the
following code segment one line at a time. As you trace through the
code, draw a diagram of the cells and pointers that result.

#+begin_src java
  Node n1 = new Node(5);
  Node n2 = new Node(10);
  n1.setNext(n2);
  n2.setNext(new Node(15));
  n2 = new Node(20);
  Node n3 = new Node(25,n2);
#+end_src

When done, compare your diagram to the rest of your breakout room.

*** Part 2
Copy over your diagram from part 1 and continue to modify it by
tracing through these lines of code:

#+begin_src java
  n2.setNext(n1);
  n1=n3;
#+end_src

Once again, share the diagram with your room.

*** Part 3

Given this diagram:

#+begin_example

    +-----+-----+        +-----+-----+    +-----+-----+     +-----+-----+

#+end_example

There already exists a Node variable P which points to (refers to) the node with the 5 in its data.

Write a code fragment to:
1. Create a new Node variable  set it to point to the node with the 10 in it.
2. Create a new Node variable and instantiate it to a new Node with a
   value of 30.
3. Write the code to insert this new Node between the 10 and the 15

   
*** Submission

Scan or take a photo of your work and upload to your ds/Pointers
folder/directory. Name the file pointers.png, pointers,pdf,
pointers.gif, or pointers.jpg depending on the file format.
