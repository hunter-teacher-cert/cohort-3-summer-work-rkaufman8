1. What is the output of the following program? 

No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

2. Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.

      main[]
      zoop[]
      baffle[]
      ping[]

  // I am actually uncertain how to create a stack diagram for methods with no variables??

3. What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method? (We will see why in the next chapter.)

If you invoke baffle() at the end of the ping method the program will get stuck in an infinite loop - ping will call baffle which calls ping which calls baffle, infinitely.
